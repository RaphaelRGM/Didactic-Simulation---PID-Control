PID Control Simulation in a Batch Brewing Plant

I am pleased to present a Python program developed in Jupyter Notebook, created with the purpose of demonstrating the operation of PID (Proportional, Integral and Derivative) control systems. This program uses the SimPy and TCLab libraries in the Visual Studio development environment. The focus of the demonstration is on simulating the performance of a PID control system in thermal variations and pH control in a Batch Brewing scenario.

Context:

Batch beer production is a complex process that requires strict temperature and pH control in several stages. PID control is widely used to ensure that these variables remain within desired ranges, directly affecting the quality and flavor of the beer.

Tools Used:

Python: The programming language chosen to create the program.
Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment that allows you to efficiently explore and document code.
SimPy: A library that enables the modeling and simulation of complex systems, essential for representing the brewing process.
TCLab: A library that allows interaction with the virtual thermal laboratory, enabling the control of process variables in real time.
Expected results:

The program simulates PID control applied to temperature and pH regulation throughout the stages of the batch brewing process. It demonstrates how the PID controller continuously adjusts process variables to maintain ideal conditions, ensuring beer quality.

Demo Benefits:

Understand the importance of PID control in the batch brewing industry.
Visualize how PID control contributes to the consistency and quality of the final product.
Learn to use Python libraries, such as SimPy and TCLab, to simulate and experiment with the control of complex processes.
Conclusion:

This demonstration offers a practical and enlightening view of PID control in a real-world scenario, in which the success of batch beer production directly depends on the precise control of process variables. Using the Jupyter Notebook environment and the SimPy and TCLab libraries in Visual Studio makes understanding and experimentation easier, providing a valuable learning opportunity in the area of control and automation engineering.

I am available to provide more information or answer any questions related to this demonstration.

Yours sincerely,
